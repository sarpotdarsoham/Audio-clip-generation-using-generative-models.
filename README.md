# Audio-clip-generation-using-generative-models.
The task is to create a generative model (either a GAN or a VAE) that would generate an audio clip based on an input parameter that specifies the genre of the audio clip. We take the DCGAN model and try to modify it to suit the task of generation of audio. We also implement conditional GAN on top of this model to achieve our results.
